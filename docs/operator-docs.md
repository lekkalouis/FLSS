# FLSS Operator Runbooks

## Purpose
This guide is for dispatch, warehouse, and customer support operators using the FLSS console.

## Daily operating modules
- **Dispatch Console (`/scan`)**
  - Scan parcels, validate order matching, and initiate booking.
- **Order Operations Board (`/ops`)**
  - Triage open orders and work through packing/dispatch exceptions.
- **Fulfillment Timeline (`/fulfillment-history`)**
  - Review shipped, delivered, and collected outcomes.
- **Customer Directory (`/contacts`)**
  - Search customer records, provinces, and account tiers.
- **Process Blueprints (`/flowcharts`)**
  - Follow standard dispatch and packing process maps.

## Operational checklists
- Confirm integrations are healthy from status indicators.
- Validate scan inputs before booking labels.
- Reconcile fulfillment outcomes at end-of-day.
- Escalate booking failures to admin team with order numbers and timestamps.
